          <strong>Project: MIT App Inventor</strong>
          <h3>Course: Computer Science Principles</h3>
          <h4>Time: September 2018 - October 2018</h4>
          <p>This project used the coding program MIT App Inventor to make our own app base on tutorials that it gives us.
          This was my second project in CSP. Our game was a states geography quiz, we finished the tutorial first and then based on the 
          tutorial we added our own ideas to make the quiz more challenge. My job was to adding more codes to make the quiz more interesting.
          My partner's job was to write our design book. Through out the whole project, I had more improved than last project. 
          Although we had a lot of errors when we tried to run the game, we still finished successfully.</p>

         <strong>Project: Scratch </strong>
         <h3>Course: Computer Science Principles</h3>
         <h4>Timeï¼šAugust 2018</h4>
         <p>This project was either to create a game or story using Scrtach.mit.edu. This was the first project I did in CSP class with my partner.
          We decided to make a story that is about a little monkey find its banana. Because Scratch already provide the blocks of code, so it was more easier 
          for us to make the story. At first we were struggled when we find out that the monkey isn't moving at the speed we want, so I changed the number of the step
          that monkey need to move. Then it was successfully worked. We also decided to give some choices that players can choose, according to their choices, they will
          get different endings. The cooperation between me and my partner was great</p>
