        <p>This is a short paragraph to introduce myself. I'm a sixteen years old girl from China, educated in Dublin High School. 
        I'm a Junior at Dublin High School. This is my first year taking CSP class. It's huge challenge to me, the reason why it's a challenge to me is 
        I have never exposed or learn anything about computer science. I often distressed and struggling about this class. Fortunately,
        I have several family members who love me, support me, and stand behind my back. 
        I have a positive attitude towards life and a wide range of interests, a strong sense of responsibility for the work,
        diligent and practical,have a strong ability to organize, publicity, pay attention to the spirit of teamwork and collective concept.
        My motto is "characters determine destiny", so I always remind myself to be honest and modest to everyone. I'm interest in art design, video editing, and audio post-production.
        I once did video post-editing in the group project of Mandarin class. After several hours of editing, I felt extremely excited and proud when the final video was successfully completed. 
        I know that my technology is not exquisite, but I hope I can learn more and know more, so that I can get more knowledge to enrich myself. 
        It's my pleasure that you read through my introduction. Thank you for your precious time.</p>
